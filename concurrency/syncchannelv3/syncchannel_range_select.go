// we have extended our cake making factory to simulate the production of
// more than 1 flavor of cake - both strawberry and chocolate now!
// But the packing mechanism is the same. Also it takes more time to make a cake
// than pack one, which means that we can gain efficiency from packing different
// types of cake with the same packing machine. Since cakes come from different
// channels and the packer cannot know the exact moment when a cake is placed on
// either or many channels, it can use the select statement and wait across all of
//  them - as soon as one of the channels is receiving a cake/data, it will implement
//   its code block
